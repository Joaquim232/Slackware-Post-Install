# Slackware-Post-Install
This is a script that i created for my use on Slackware Linux, but if you want to use it too, you're free to use it. REMEMBER: Don't say something was missing from this script, because I created it for MY use.

You can also edit it for your needs, for example: In a part of this script, there's a command that says to create 2 files in /home but the user is with my name, so you can edit the script changing it to your user name. Or add things that are not on it by default. :)
